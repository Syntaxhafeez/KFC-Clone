# 🍗 KFC Clone

A simple clone of the official KFC website to showcase my web development skills. This project replicates the design and functionality of the original site, allowing users to explore how a popular fast-food website is structured using basic web technologies.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

This project is a front-end recreation of the KFC website, built to demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While it doesn't replicate all the features of the live site, it mirrors the layout and design elements, providing a close approximation for learning and development purposes.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling the website to match the look and feel of KFC's official site.
- **JavaScript**: Adding basic interactivity and functionality.

## 💻 How to Use

1. **View Code**: You can view the code and related images in the repository.
2. **Copy & Paste**:
   - Create an `index.html` file and paste the HTML code.
   - Create a `style.css` file for the CSS code.
   - Create a `script.js` file for the JavaScript code.
3. **Run Locally**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the clone in action.
